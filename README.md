# Cerebral-Connections
## 💡 Inspiration

Covid-19 has stressed everyone out of their mind. 🧠  With the protest for various social justice issues and remote learning & work our mental health has been thrown out of whack 😰 and out of focus as we pay attention to our physical health. 💪  The Covid-19 Pandemic can potentially affect your physical health, but it has **definitely** affected everyone’s mental health. We wanted to remind everyone to take care of their mind as much as they do their bodies.
